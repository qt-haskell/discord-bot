      <h2>⭐ Awesome Bug Reports</h2>
      <p>Hey, cutie! When you're submitting a bug report, there are a few things you should keep in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>👀 Don't be a copycat! Make sure to search the issues first to avoid duplicates. We're all about originality here!</li>
        <li>🔎 If you're reporting an error, include the complete traceback so we can figure out what went wrong. We're not mind readers, after all!</li>
        <li>📝 Give us the deets! Make sure to provide enough information to help us understand the problem.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>💬 Give us a quick summary of the issue in human terms. Don't make us read a novel!</li>
          <li>🔍 Let us know how to reproduce the issue. What were you doing when it happened? How often does it happen?</li>
          <li>🤔 Tell us what you expected to happen. We're not psychics, so we need to know your expectations!</li>
          <li>💥 Tell us what actually happens. How does it fail? Does it give an error message?</li>
          <li>🚀 Give us info about your system. What OS are you using? Are your requirements up-to-date? This helps us help you!</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>If your bug report is missing any of this information, it might take us longer to fix the issue. We might need to ask you for clarification, and if we don't hear back from you, we'll have to close the issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>💌 Sending a Pull Request</h2>
      <p>Ready to submit a pull request? Awesome! Just make sure it's focused on one thing and doesn't get out of hand. And if you could make it look pretty, that would be amazing! Plus, we like to keep everything documented so the code is self-explanatory. 💁‍♀️</p>
      <h4>Git Commit Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>📝 Use a short, descriptive commit message. We don't need a novel!</li>
        <li>📏 Keep each line under 72 characters. Short and sweet, just like us!</li>
        <li>📎 Please don't use full URLs - just the shorthand! It saves us time.</li>
        <li>📖 Use the commit body to explain what and why, not how. We don't need step-by-step instructions!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your pull request doesn't meet these guidelines, we might ask you to make some changes before we merge it. But don't worry - we're here to help you shine!</p>
    </div>
